### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro Pareschi, I'm initiating my journey towards becoming a full stack Java developer! Here I'll put some of my projects, including college/course challenges and some ideas I create myself. I hope you enjoy what you see, and hopefully we can work on something together!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java programming with Spring framework and related technologies such as Hibernate, JWT, S3, JDBC, JUnit, MySQL e MongoDB. Also giving my firts steps into front-end development with Ionic.
