### Hi there 👋

My name is Pedro Pareschi, I'm initiating my journey towards becoming a full stack Java developer! Here I'll put some of my projects, including college/course challenges and some ideas
I create myself. I hope you enjoy what you see and maybe we can work on something together!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Ionic and focusing on becoming a full stack developer. This is all thanks to the following courses:
