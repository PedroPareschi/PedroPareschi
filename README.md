### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro Pareschi, I'm initiating my journey towards becoming a full stack Java developer! 

Here I'll put some of my projects, including college/course challenges and some ideas I create myself. I hope you enjoy what you see, and hopefully we can work on something together!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java programming with Spring framework and related technologies such as Hibernate, JWT, S3, JDBC, JUnit, MySQL e MongoDB. 

Furthermore, I'm also giving my first steps into front-end frameworks and languages, namely JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, JavaFX, Angular and Ionic
